# How to use

Provide your own Youtube v3 API key in `example.env` and rename the file to `.env`
Then you can either build or just `cargo run` and provide either a `https://open.spotify.com` or a `https://deezer.page.link` as an argument and it should fetch the given song as a youtube link.

This was just another programming test for myself so I can'T say that the good is good or working 100% of the time.
